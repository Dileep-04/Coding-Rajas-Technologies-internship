SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool in natural language processing aimed at understanding and categorizing emotions expressed in text data. 
The primary goal of sentiment analysis is to automatically classify the sentiment expressed in a piece of text as positive, negative, or neutral. It helps in understanding the opinions, attitudes, and emotions of individuals or groups towards a particular subject or topic.
Sentiment analysis finds wide-ranging applications across various industries. It is extensively used in market research to gauge customer satisfaction, in social media monitoring to understand public opinion, in brand monitoring to track reputation, in customer service to address complaints effectively, and in political analysis to assess public sentiment towards policies and politicians.
The Project is made on the basis of one of the most trending technology which is Machine learning (ML), Logistic Regression is used in the project for model training. 

Steps involved in creating a sentiment analysis project:

a. Data Collection: Gather a diverse dataset of text documents relevant to the domain of analysis. This can include social media posts, customer reviews, news articles, or any other form of text data.

b. Data Preprocessing: Clean the text data by removing noise such as special characters, punctuation, and stopwords. Tokenize the text into words or phrases and normalize them (e.g., converting to lowercase).

c. Feature Extraction: Convert the textual data into numerical features that can be used for analysis. Common techniques include Bag-of-Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and word embeddings such as Word2Vec or GloVe.

d. Model Selection: Choose a suitable machine learning or deep learning model for sentiment analysis. Popular choices include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), or pre-trained models like BERT or GPT.

e. Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the selected model on the training data and tune its hyperparameters to optimize performance.

f. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test dataset to assess its performance in classifying sentiments accurately.

g.Web page: Designing a basic web page using HTML,CSS and Javascript at frontend ,  creating another interface using Flask at backned purpose.

h. Deployment: Deploy the trained model in the newly designed web page , to perform sentiment analysis on new text data.
